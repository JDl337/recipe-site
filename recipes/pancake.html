    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Perfect pancakes</strong> are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around
    delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably <em>already in your kitchen</em> (and it's so much better than
      the boxed stuff).</p>
